Can you succeed and bring light to the land once more?",

    skills: ["C# Scripting","Git","Unity"],
    about: "Take in the peaceful sounds of nature while you play as a ladybug trying to complete math equations. You can customize the difficulty to your liking! You can choose what operations appear and how long the equations are. No worries if you can't figure it out, adjust the settings or just generate a new problem. Enjoy!",
    gameplay: "Crawl around the board and push around math blocks to construct a valid equation! Each equation is randomly generated, so every level is different! A level may have more than one solution, see if you can find them all!",
